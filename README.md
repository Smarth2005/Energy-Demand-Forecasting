### AI-Driven Energy Consumption Prediction: Harnessing Data for a Smarter, Sustainable Future

### Background: The Energy Crisis We Can‚Äôt Ignore

<div align="justify">
  
Can we imagine a day when we cannot even switch on the lights and fans due to lack of energy resources that generate electricity? With energy resources depleting at an alarming rate, this scenario might not be as distant as we think.

In the heart of a bustling city, millions of lights glow in empty skyscrapers, factories overconsume electricity, and homes unknowingly waste power. Alex, a city planner, watches from his office window, concerned about the inefficiencies in energy distribution. Every night, office buildings remain fully illuminated‚Äîeven when empty. Factories continue consuming electricity at peak hours, overloading the grid.

On the other side of town, Sophie, an environmental activist, fights against the rising carbon emissions, knowing that poor energy management is accelerating climate change. While many push for renewable energy sources, the real challenge lies in how energy is consumed. Even with the cleanest sources, inefficient usage results in waste, driving up costs and carbon footprints.

As global energy demand surges, power grids struggle to keep up, leading to:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Frequent blackouts disrupting industries and homes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rising electricity costs burdening consumers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased carbon emissions, worsening climate change

The world stands at a critical juncture:
> **Are we to leave our successors a world burdened by wasteful energy consumption and a fragile environment?**
> **Can we harness AI to predict and optimize energy consumption before it‚Äôs too late?**

<div align="justify">
  
In a world where every watt counts and sustainability is no longer a choice but a necessity, the imperative for intelligent, data-driven solutions has never been greater. Guided by the conviction that ‚Äúenergy misused today cannot be excused tomorrow,‚Äù our group project addresses the pressing challenges of energy overconsumption and inefficiency by harnessing the transformative power of artificial intelligence. As Roy Cooper aptly stated, ‚ÄúA strong renewable energy industry is good for our environment and our economy.‚Äù Yet, even the cleanest energy sources fall short without efficient consumption and management.

### Problem Statement

<p align="center">

  </p>

<div align="justify">
The accelerating depletion of finite energy resources poses a profound threat to global economic stability, environmental integrity, and intergenerational equity. Despite strides in renewable energy, persistent inefficiencies in demand forecasting and consumption optimization perpetuate systemic waste‚Äîmanifested in the needless illumination of vacant buildings, industrial overcapacity, and unchecked household carbon footprints. This mismanagement contravenes fundamental thermodynamic principles, effectively eroding energy‚Äôs potential utility and exacerbating issues such as air pollution, volatile markets, and fragile infrastructure. Traditional forecasting methods, reliant on static averages and simplistic regressions, fail to capture the intricate, dynamic interplay of temporal, meteorological, and sector-specific factors driving modern energy consumption. Addressing this critical gap requires a paradigm shift toward intelligent, machine learning-driven prediction and optimization systems. By leveraging advanced models‚Äîincluding XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Trees‚Äîour project endeavors to transcend reactive energy management, enabling proactive stewardship that enhances resource efficiency, curbs emissions, and facilitates seamless integration of renewables, thereby laying the groundwork for a sustainable energy future.
<br><br>
To tackle these challenges, we employ a suite of advanced regression models-including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost-to build a robust energy consumption prediction system. By leveraging historical usage patterns, weather data, and sector-specific trends, our approach aspires not only to reduce waste and optimize distribution but also 
to support the global transition toward sustainability.

#### Mission
- Develop accurate and robust machine learning models to predict energy consumption across sectors.
- Enable proactive energy management that reduces waste and supports smart grid reliability.
- Facilitate informed decision-making for businesses, governments, and consumers to promote sustainable energy usage.
- Raise awareness about energy efficiency as a key pillar of environmental responsibility and economic stability.

###  Tools and Technologies Used

- **XGBoost:** For energy consumption prediction.
- **Pandas, NumPy:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly:** For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn:** For model evaluation and feature selection.
- **PyCaret:** For automated model comparison,allowing for efficient experimentation with different machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model for energy consumption prediction.

### Data Sources
<div align="justify">
For this project, we have utilized real-time energy consumption and weather data sourced from credible and authoritative platforms. The energy usage statistics were collected from: 
https://iced.niti.gov.in/energy/electricity/distribution/national-level-consumption/load-curve,  Copyright ¬© 2025, NITI Aayog. 
While the platform primarily relies on official sources, in certain instances, some assumptions have been made or data has been derived. These details are mentioned explicitly within the platform. Although we believe the data to be reliable and sufficiently comprehensive, NITI Aayog ICED does not guarantee absolute accuracy and accepts no liability for consequences arising from the use of this 
information. Complementing this, the weather data ‚Äî including variables such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation ‚Äî was obtained from https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-query-builder/, ensuring both temporal precision and contextual relevance. <br><br>
The combined dataset spans from January 2023 to April 2024, offering a robust 15-month window that captures seasonal variations and demand patterns across different weather conditions. By integrating these datasets, we aim to effectively capture the dynamic relationship between environmental factors and energy consumption ‚Äî paving the way for smarter forecasting models and sustainability-driven insights.
